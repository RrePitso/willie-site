# Willie du Plessis Financial Services - Modern Website Concept

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a modern, mobile-responsive website redesign for **Willie du Plessis Financial Services**. The goal was to shift the digital brand from a corporate entity to a "family-first" consultancy, emphasizing trust, personal connection, and local presence in East London.

## ✨ Key Features
* **"Uncle Willie" Interactive Animation:** A custom JavaScript interaction where the founder points at the user when they hover over the Call-to-Action button, reinforcing the "guidance" theme.
* **Mobile-First Architecture:** Fully responsive layout that ensures the "Call Now" buttons and contact forms work perfectly on smartphones.
* **Visual Storytelling:**
    * **Hero Section:** Features the full team (Crew) with a premium Navy overlay.
    * **Polaroid Gallery:** A CSS-styled photo stack highlighting the team's local presence on the road.
* **Brand Integration:** Uses the official Navy Blue (`#002855`) and Gold (`#C5A028`) color palette.
* **Fallback Reliability:** Includes a text-based logo fallback system in case the image fails to load.
